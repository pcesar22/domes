Notes:
"JLCPCB SPEAKER SELECTION - Since there are 3000+ speaker options, you'll need to select based on these criteria:
- Impedance: 4-8 ohm
- Power: 0.5-1W minimum
- Size: ~10-20mm diameter (miniature)
- Mounting: Through-hole or can use solder pads
- Popular options to search: ""miniature speaker"" ""8ohm speaker"" ""1W speaker""
- Examples: Knowles SpeakerMax series, TDK ECS series
- Recommended: Search JLCPCB parts library by impedance/power to find current stock"

"ASSEMBLY NOTES:
1. Upload this CSV to JLCPCB's assembly tool for BOM validation
2. All components listed are available on JLCPCB (except speaker - choose from library)
3. Total assembled cost should be $18-25 per unit at 100 qty
4. Most components are on JLCPCB's 'basic' parts list (lower assembly fees)
5. For speaker selection: Visit jlcpcb.com/parts and filter by:
   - Category: Audio Components / Speakers
   - Impedance: 4-8Ω
   - Power: 500mW-1W
   - Package: Through-hole"
