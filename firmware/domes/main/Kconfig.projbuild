            When enabled, the firmware will automatically check GitHub
            for new releases on boot (requires WiFi connection).

            Disable this during development to avoid unexpected updates.

            For production, OTA updates are delivered via BLE from the
            phone app, not via WiFi auto-check.

    config DOMES_WIFI_AUTO_CONNECT
        bool "Enable automatic WiFi connection on boot"
        default y
        help
            When enabled, the firmware will automatically connect to WiFi
            using credentials stored in NVS or from secrets.hpp.

            Disable this if you don't need WiFi during development.
