## 4. OPEN QUESTIONS

### Feature Prioritization
1. Which Tier 3 features are most compelling for v1?
2. Should we focus on one vertical first (e.g., PT clinics vs athletes)?
3. How important is the modular/upgrade path vs simpler single-SKU?

### Differentiation Strategy
1. Is "no subscription" enough, or do we need a hardware breakthrough?
2. Open-source: Fully open vs open API with proprietary core?
3. Price positioning: Undercut aggressively ($149) or mid-market ($299)?

### Use Cases to Explore
1. Are there underserved niches (elderly cognitive, special needs, gaming)?
2. Should we partner with specific sports/PT organizations early?
3. B2B (gyms, clinics) vs B2C (home users) focus?

## 5. COMPETITIVE MOAT STRATEGY

### Short-term Differentiation
1. **Price**: Undercut BlazePod by 50-60%
2. **No Subscription**: Major selling point
3. **Open Source**: Build community, earn trust
4. **Repairability**: Stand out from disposable competitors

### Long-term Moat
1. **Ecosystem**: Community-created drills, accessories
2. **API/SDK**: Third-party integrations
3. **Data Network Effects**: Better AI with more users
4. **Brand Loyalty**: Right-to-repair advocates, coaches
