# Claude Code Documentation

This project was created and is maintained with assistance from Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude.

## About Claude Code

Claude Code is an interactive CLI tool that helps with software engineering tasks, including:
- Code generation and refactoring
- Bug fixing and debugging
- Documentation creation
- Test development
- Code review and optimization

## Working with Claude

When working on this project with Claude Code:

1. **Clear Communication**: Provide specific, detailed requirements for the best results
2. **Iterative Development**: Claude can help break down complex tasks into manageable steps
3. **Code Review**: Always review Claude's suggestions before committing changes
4. **Context Awareness**: Claude understands the project structure and can maintain consistency

## Project Sessions

Claude Code sessions are tracked to maintain context and ensure continuity across development tasks.

### Current Branch
This documentation was created on branch: `claude/create-documentation-files-gJwGB`

## Available Skills

The following skills are available in `.claude/skills/`:

### debug-esp32 (GDB Debugging)
**Trigger**: Use when user asks to "debug", "gdb", "breakpoint", "step through", "backtrace", "info stack", "inspect variable", or investigate crashes.

Provides ESP32-S3 GDB debugging via MCP tools. Key features:
- Start/stop debug sessions with OpenOCD + GDB
- Set breakpoints at functions or file:line
- Step through code (step into, step over, finish)
- Inspect variables, memory, registers
- View FreeRTOS tasks
- Full call stack (backtrace)

**IMPORTANT**: Always read `.claude/skills/debug-esp32/SKILL.md` before debugging to follow the correct workflow (async continue, reset halt, etc.)

### esp32-firmware
**Trigger**: Use when user asks to "build", "flash", "monitor", or work with ESP-IDF.

Provides ESP32 firmware build/flash/monitor commands.

### github-workflow
**Trigger**: Use for GitHub Actions and CI/CD tasks.

## Best Practices

- Keep commits atomic and well-described
- Review all AI-generated code for security and correctness
- Use Claude for exploration, implementation, and documentation
- Maintain clear documentation for human developers
- **For debugging**: Always use the debug-esp32 skill and follow its workflow
